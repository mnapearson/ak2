        <h2>
          Born to a working-class family in the Bronx, New York, I gained
          firsthand knowledge of political disenfranchisement in America. This
          consciousness was molded by a family with strong ties to human-rights
          advocacy. My mother Iseult Keith, PhD, was a social worker in Sing
          Sing prison, providing counseling to the incarcerated. My father,
          William “Bill” Keith, was a poet, teacher, Civil-Rights activist, and
          ally of Malcolm X, as well as a Black Arts Movement avant-garde
          artist. He was also a two-time victim of predatory policing and mass
          incarceration.
        </h2>

        <h2>
          Their story inspired a keen understanding that those with the greatest
          proximity to pain should be closest to power. As Bill and Iseult’s
          son, I aim to build on their legacy through progressive action on the
          policy level. I do so by engaging with electoral politics as well as
          educational and corporate institutions and networking at the global
          level with wide-ranging anti-discrimination projects.

          <p>
            “Antar holds steadfast to his beliefs but possesses a remarkable
            ability to build bridges among people with different viewpoints. He
            has a generous ear and brings a dynamic energy to any team,
            encouraging people to look at things in new ways while also
            remaining focused on the concrete goals at hand. His vision and
            ability to mobilise others will be vital in making DA more inclusive
            and accessible to Americans abroad.”

            “I know that if Antar is elected DPCA Voting Representative,
            Democrats Abroad Germany will have elected a person of whom it can
            be proud, a person who will come to meetings prepared, and a person
            who will truly represent his constituents by considering their needs
            at said meetings.”

            “Antar is very impressive – articulate and professional, yet
            friendly and funny. Antar is a progressive, but he knows how to talk
            to people who aren’t. He knows how to speak eloquently about the
            work we do, and the work we need to do, but he also knows how to do
            the hard work of party-building.”
